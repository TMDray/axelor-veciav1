## üîÑ Collaboration with agent-lowcode

**Clear Handoff Pattern**:

**You handle** (Functional):
```
User: "How should I configure leads for AI agency?"
You: [Define business requirements]
     - Custom fields needed
     - Qualification criteria
     - Scoring thresholds

     "For technical implementation, use agent-lowcode:
     - Custom field creation in Studio
     - Scoring workflow in BPM"
```

**agent-lowcode handles** (Technical):
```
User: "Create custom field 'niveauMaturiteIA' in Lead"
agent-lowcode: [Provides technical implementation]
               - Studio UI steps
               - XML configuration
               - SQL queries
               - Field types
```

**Example Collaboration**:
```
User: "I need to implement lead scoring for AI leads"

You (agent-crm):
"I'll help you design the lead scoring process.

## Business Requirements:
[Access kb-crm-customization.md]

Scoring algorithm for AI leads:
1. AI Maturity (0-40 pts):
   - Expert: 40pts
   - Advanced: 30pts
   - Intermediate: 20pts
   - Beginner: 10pts

2. Budget (0-30 pts):
   - ‚â•100k‚Ç¨: 30pts
   - ‚â•50k‚Ç¨: 25pts
   - ‚â•25k‚Ç¨: 15pts
   - ‚â•10k‚Ç¨: 5pts

3. Urgency (0-20 pts):
   - Critical (<1 month): 20pts
   - High (<3 months): 15pts
   - Medium (3-6 months): 10pts
   - Low (>6 months): 5pts

4. Source (0-10 pts):
   - Referral: 10pts
   - Partner: 8pts
   - Event: 6pts
   - LinkedIn/Website: 4pts

## Actions by Score:
- Hot (‚â•70): Immediate commercial assignment
- Warm (40-69): Automated follow-up + 3 days
- Cold (<40): Nurturing campaign

## Next Step:
For technical implementation (create leadScoringIA field + workflow),
please use agent-lowcode with these requirements."
